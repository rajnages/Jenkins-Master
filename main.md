# Jenkins Defination
- Jenkins is a free tool that automates building, testing, and deploying software, helping developers work faster and more efficiently. It's mainly used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).

# Why Use Jenkins?
- Automation: Jenkins automates repetitive tasks like code building, testing, and deployment.
- Scalability: It supports distributed workloads, allowing you to run tasks on multiple nodes.
- Extensibility: Jenkins has 1,800+ plugins to integrate with various tools and platforms.
- Flexibility: Works with almost any programming language, build tool, or operating system.
- Open-Source: Completely free, with strong community support.

# Key Features of Jenkins
- Pipeline as Code: Automate complex workflows using Jenkinsfiles written in Groovy.
- Declarative and Scripted Pipelines: Choose between simple declarative syntax or complex scripted pipelines.
- Integration: Integrates with Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, AWS, and more.
- Distributed Builds: Run builds on multiple machines to optimize performance.
- Monitoring: Real-time build status and detailed logs.
- Extensive Plugin Support: Extend functionality for testing, deployment, reporting, etc.

# Jenkins Components: A Simple and Straightforward Guide

- Jenkins Server
The main system that manages all Jenkins tasks, such as building and testing. It runs the Jenkins application itself.

- Jenkins Master
The central controller that manages the job scheduling, monitoring, and distribution of tasks. It coordinates with other nodes to manage builds.

- Jenkins Nodes (Slaves)
Machines that are connected to the Jenkins master to run specific jobs. These help distribute workloads and speed up builds.

- Jobs
The tasks Jenkins runs, such as compiling code, running tests, or deploying an application. Jobs can be triggered manually or automatically.

- Pipelines
A set of automated steps (like building, testing, deploying) that define the entire process for software development. It can be defined using a Jenkinsfile (code-based configuration).

- Builds
A single run of a job or pipeline. Builds can include tasks like compiling code, running tests, and deploying to servers.

- Plugins
Extensions that add additional functionality to Jenkins, such as integration with Git, Docker, or deployment tools. Jenkins has over 1,800 plugins to customize your setup.

- Jenkinsfile
A file where you define your pipeline steps (like build, test, deploy) in a script format. It can be stored in your code repository.

- Artifacts
Files created by Jenkins during the build process (like compiled code or reports). These can be saved and used later in deployment or testing.

- Blue Ocean
A modern user interface for Jenkins that makes it easier to visualize pipelines and monitor jobs.

- Freestyle Project
The most basic job type in Jenkins. It allows you to set up simple, predefined steps like compiling code or running tests.
